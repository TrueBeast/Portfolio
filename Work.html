			<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was to make subtle changes to an environment not too drastic but just enough to improve it by a little. I used some saturation filter on this and made the sunset a little bit brighter. I also made the snow a little more appealing by making it pop out more. I took away the hay around the tree to make the tree stand out more. </p>
				<p class="description">The reason why I selected this environment was because it made me feel at peace and that the tree was a thing of beauty, like out of all the trees in the world this was the best out of all of them. Beause of its isolation state </p>

			<p class="description" class="scroll">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was to make an advertisement design for example a movie poster. I like action movies so I tried to make an action type of design which also gave me a great game idea. But first how I made this design was first taking a picture of myself as you can see. Then I took Iron man’s helmet and boots then put them proportionate to my body size. Then I went on google to find the perfect dragon this was the hardest part trying to find a dragon that kind of matched the environment I was using. I settled on this dragon that’s on the top right of the picture. This dragon came from "Skyrim" It wasn't the type I was looking for but it was close enough the fire it was breathing is what made me decide on it. </p>
				<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Title of this movie I thought of was "The adventures of Iron Kid the Dragon Slayer". The story I wanted to write for this is set in a steam punk world which is kind of the last place you would see dragons still alive but I like mixing things together. It follows a boy named Rex he was a great inventor ever since he could hold a wrench. He heard rumors and legends that Dragons of old would come back from deep within earth to conquer over humans. His parents told him not to believe in such fairy tales, but he did he started of thinking of ways to defeat dragons if such a time came. One day he felt an earth quake one of which he has never felt he looked outside and saw not one but many Dragons terrorizing the city. His designs up to now has all failed and he has not thought of any new ideas for a design. Until he looked over to where his dads study was and saw a knight’s armor. Then he realized that was the best design armor made out of iron just like how people back in the medieval days fought dragons, he started working on it immediately. That is how Rex came to be Iron Kid the Dragon Slayer.</p>
