		<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born and raised in Bridgeport Ct. My parents are both imigrants from Haiti coming to America so their kids an have a better life. Ever since I was little I have always had an imagination that I walways wanted to come to life in some way. </p>
			<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It first started with legos the way it felt to make something out of nothing, and the feeling of solving a problem of a design that didn't work felt like the feeling you get when your crush kisses you for the first time. After legos I went to tinkering with things takign it apart then trying to put it back together if it worked after i put it back I was happy, if it didnt work I pretended like I never had the item or it didn't exist. </p>
				<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in middle school choosing what high school to go to I chose a Tech school with a specialty in electrical. It was fun designing efficient wiring blueprints then actually using your design to solve a problem I was pretty good not at first but after the 4 years I could wire any house if you told me the problem you want me to fix. </p>
					<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made me not pursue this dream was due to my new curiosity on how computers worked. So I started teaching my self how to program. This process was the most boring thing I ever tried to do but it didnt deter me from Computer Science it just made me want to conquer it which is what drove me to apply to colleges that had this program available. </p>
						<p class="description">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended up going to Uconn to pursue this degree not only because it was close to home but because all the other colleges were expensive and I hate debt. The first semester in school was not what I expected because they started me of with the language of Matlab. This language didn't really catch my eye as something I wanted to learn to me it was basically programming a calculator.</p>
